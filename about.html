        Prisca Marie Roseline is my name. I'm a 22-year-old woman who studies at onja, which is a project that helps young people to run their career. I've got my bachelor's degree at high school Brickaville for four years. And I have been learning programming for this year. I have no experince of any professional jobs yet. But it has always been my dream to be a professional woman. And I am in way to fight for it to come true now. No matter how hard, it is. I'm from a poor background, and that motivates me so much to achieve my goal because I want my descendants to live in better life. I therefore want to change women's perspectives to not always depend on men in life. I've always been keen on travelling so much since I was a kid, so that will be one of my favourite things, which I'd like to do, when my dream comes true. I love the thought of sport,but I am not a sporty woman though.
