        How do we learn<mark> multiculture</mark>?
      </h2>  
      <p>
        Learning <mark>multiculture</mark> is such a hard thing to do because it is often really different from what you either have used to do or bilieved since you were a kid. So it requires humility and patience. You have to admit it whether you like or not. However, it is so nice to live with different people when you are used to thier cultures. As I study in a boarding school, I have experienced it a lot. We are 25 people here from different places. We all have our own culture, so we have to deal with it everyday. The thing which we do is keep ours and respect for the others.
