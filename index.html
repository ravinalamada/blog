          <p>
            Mahanoro is small town in the South-Est of Madagascar. It is great place to live as it's quiet and at the coast as well.

            <h2>Welcome to Mahanoro</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, people love going on holiday at the coast so much, as the weather is always cool there and they can swim for free in the sea. So if you include in that, I'd like to suggest you to go in Mahanoro. It has great places, which called Ambatolatabatra, where you can do picnic with family or hang out with friends. It is also the cheapest place at the coast of Madagascar.
